# Philippine LRT/MRT Transport System Simulation

This project is my final submission for the Fundamentals of Programming course. It simulates the Light Rail Transit (LRT) and Metro Rail Transit (MRT) systems in the Philippines, allowing users to navigate the rail networks, calculate fares, and manage travel cards.

## Project Description

This C programming project creates a comprehensive simulation of the Philippine metro rail transportation system, including LRT-1, LRT-2, and MRT-3 lines. The program enables users to:

- Select origin and destination stations across all metro rail lines
- Calculate fare costs based on accurate fare matrices
- Simulate loading and using stored value cards for payment
- Navigate between connected stations and transfer points
- Experience a virtual journey through the metro rail network

## Features

- **Station Selection**: Choose from all operational stations across LRT-1, LRT-2, and MRT-3 lines
- **Fare Calculation**: Accurate implementation of the current fare matrix used by the actual transit systems
- **Card System**: Simulation of the stored value card system including loading, payment, and balance checking
- **Route Planning**: Determine optimal routes between stations, including transfers between lines
- **User Interface**: Text-based interface guiding users through the transit experience
- **Transfer Points**: Implementation of key interchange stations like Doroteo Jose, Recto, and Araneta Center-Cubao

## Technical Implementation

The project demonstrates mastery of fundamental C programming concepts including:
- Control structures (if-else, switch-case, loops)
- Arrays and multi-dimensional arrays for station and fare data
- Functions for modular program design
- File handling for data persistence
- Input validation and error handling

## Learning Outcomes

This project showcases my understanding of fundamental programming concepts while creating a practical application that models a real-world system familiar to many Filipinos.
